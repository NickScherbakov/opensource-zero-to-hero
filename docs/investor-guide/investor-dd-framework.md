- **Market Position**: 50-100% premium for category leaders
- **Network Effects**: 2-5x premium for strong ecosystem lock-in

**Sample Valuation Calculation:**
```
Base SaaS Valuation: $50M ARR × 10x = $500M
+ Community Premium: 25K stars × $25 = $625K  
+ Open Source Premium: $500M × 50% = $250M
+ Market Leadership Premium: $500M × 25% = $125M
= Total Valuation: $875M
